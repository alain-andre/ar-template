# Objective
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/alain-andre/ar-template/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/alain-andre/ar-template)

This template creates a Rails project working with a server API and a AngularJS application. It comes with a generator that scaffold all the primary files to work (see [Example](#example)).

It is based on [monterail](http://monterail.com/) ideas and a mix of [mines](http://www.alain-andre.fr/blog/2015/01/23/configurer-rails-avec-angularjs/). Once created, the project can generate **angular_scaffold** wich include **migration**, **api**, **controller**, **model** and **CRUD templates**.

CRUD is allowed to only admin users. A **role** is added to [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) user and set by default to 0 (lambda) on creation. The `javascripts/routes` will then use the [Rails JS environment](http://www.alain-andre.fr/blog/2015/01/23/configurer-rails-avec-angularjs/) to allow or not access to admin templates.

You can create helpers to define users *role* like this template do for admin users in `application_controller.rb`.

```ruby
# Define if the current_user is allowed to CRUD.
def is_admin?
  if current_user
    return true if current_user.is_admin?
  end
end 
```

## Required
This generator will need the [pg dev library](https://github.com/alain-andre/ar-template/issues/19) and the sqlite dev library (libsqlite3-dev for debian based). Be sure to have it installed before templating your new project.

## How it works
First of all, the `templates` function of `lib/templates_paths.rb` list all the files to work with AngularJS. It is then used in the `app/controllers/concerns/js_env.rb` concern that creates an AngularJS module called **share** and is inserted in the `application.html` file of the project.

This way, it is possible to pass a lot of rails informations to the AngularJS application like the liste of templates, the rails environement etc.

### Create a controller
@todo
### Create a model
@todo
### Create a view
@todo
### Scaffolding
@todo split the code into model, view, controller

# Example
Use the rakefile to generate a new project :
`bundle exec rake new_app['new_project']`

You will have the following options :
 * Generate rspec installation?
 * Add devise gem amd configure it?
  * Add role to the user model?
  * Add browserid authentication?
 * Generate angular scaffolding?
  * What is the Object name to scaffold?
  * What's the structure of the object? (describe it like a model generation)

# Benefits
  * Use generators
  * Use erb and haml in JS files (assets)
  * Use partials in haml templates (assets)
  * Using the I18 power for files structure

# Generators
  * [angular_scaffold](https://github.com/alain-andre/ar-template/tree/master/template/lib/generators/angular_scaffold)
  * [auth_browserid](https://github.com/alain-andre/ar-template/tree/master/template/lib/generators/auth_browserid)

# Testing
This template is using [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails). Run `bundle exec rspec` inside your new generated project to test your generators.

# Documentation
Technical documentation can be generated by running `bundle exec yard`.

If you prefer running yard server do : `bundle exec yard server`.
